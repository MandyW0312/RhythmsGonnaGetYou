Problem:

- Model and Create a Database (RecordCompany)
- Starting a record label company and we have a place to store our Bands, Albums, and eventually Songs
- Create a console app that stores the info into a Database

C R U D

- Create: Create Albums, Songs, & Bands
- Read: View the Bands, Albums, and Albums of Specific Bands
- Update: Resign a Band, Release a Band from Contract
- Delete: Not Really Deleting any info from the Database

Examples:

- Our Record Company Releases ABBA from its Record Contract.
- Our Record Company decides that it wants to Resign ABBA to a Record Contract.

- We want to Add the Album ‘Kilroy Was Here‘, to the Band STYX.
- We want to Add the Song ‘Mr.Roboto‘, to the Album 'Kilroy Was Here'.
- We want to View all the Albums for Night Ranger.
